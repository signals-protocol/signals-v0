# signals-v0

Welcome to **signals-v0**, a revolutionary prediction market platform for continuous outcomes.

## What is signals-v0?

signals-v0 enables prediction markets on **continuous outcomes** like asset prices, market indices, and any numerical value. Instead of simple yes/no questions, you can bet on specific **price ranges** with mathematical precision.

### Key Innovation: Range Securities

- **Traditional**: "Will ETH be above $3000?" (Binary)
- **signals-v0**: "ETH will be between $3200-$3400" (Range)

Each range security pays **1 USDC** if the outcome falls within your chosen range.

## Why signals-v0?

### ðŸ’° Earn from Correct Predictions

## How It Works
