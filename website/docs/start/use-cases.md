# Ways to Use Signals

Signals trades a single asset--Bitcoin--but a continuous range market opens more playbooks than a simple bullish or bearish bet. The same primitives that let you back tonight's close can help you fine-tune risk, extract information, or run programs for a community. The sections below walk through several approaches we see live on the venue.

## Intraday speculation

A discretionary trader can treat each $100 bin as a statement about where the candle ends. When momentum builds, buying a ladder of ranges above spot lets you express increasingly aggressive targets while paying the CLMSR cost that matches the shift in probability. If the move fades, you can close or rotate into lower ranges in a single transaction, keeping the position path-independent. Because probabilities always normalise to 1, you see instantly how the crowd reprices your thesis after every trade.

## Hedging and treasury work

Teams that hold BTC-denominated liabilities use Signals to pin risk around a budget level. Selecting a cluster of ranges around the required close effectively caps next-day exposure without negotiating bespoke OTC trades. Treasurers can also approximate collars or digitals by holding offsetting ranges above and below a strike, letting the CLMSR pool replicate payoff shapes that would otherwise require multiple venues. The ability to unwind or roll ranges intraday keeps the hedge aligned as markets move.

## Market intelligence and research

Analysts follow the probability surface to understand how traders absorb upcoming data releases. Instead of scraping fragmented order books, they observe one continuous curve and log shifts in the implied close. Leaderboard activity and settlement records provide a public, timestamped trail, so research teams can backtest how specific wallets behaved around CPI prints, ETF flows, or halving milestones. The dataset is on-chain, making it easy to plug into notebooks or dashboards.

## Community and product programs

Communities run nightly prediction challenges on top of Signals because results settle transparently. Event organisers pre-announce the target market, track entrants directly from the on-chain record, and award prizes after settlement without manual reconciliation. Product teams embed the same data into newsletters or social recapsâ€”readers see which ranges cleared, how probabilities evolved, and what that says about sentiment heading into the next session.
