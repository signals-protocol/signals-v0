# Ways to Use Signals

Signals focuses on one asset—Bitcoin—but the range mechanic fits many strategies. Here are a few patterns we see:

## Short-term speculation

- Fade or follow momentum by backing bands above or below the current spot price.
- Scale into multiple adjacent ranges as conviction changes through the day.

## Hedging & treasury ops

- Lock in exposure around a key level if you manage BTC-denominated liabilities.
- Combine ranges to approximate collars or digital spreads on daily closes.

## Market intelligence

- Watch the probability surface to monitor sentiment leading into macro events.
- Track leaderboard activity to see which ranges attract the smartest capital.

## Community engagement

- Run prediction challenges around daily closes and award points or prizes to winners.
- Use the settled data as a transparent record for research, newsletters, or social content.
