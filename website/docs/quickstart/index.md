## How Range Trading Works

### Understanding Range Securities

Instead of betting "yes" or "no", you buy **ranges**:

**Example: BTC Price Market**

- Current price: $51,000
- Available ranges: $48,000-$50,000, $50,000-$52,000, $52,000-$54,000, etc.
- Each range pays **1 SUSD** if BTC settles in that range

### Price = Probability

If a range costs 0.25 SUSD, the market thinks there's a 25% chance of that outcome.

### Multiple Ranges

You can buy multiple ranges to express complex predictions:

- Bullish: Buy $52,000-$54,000 + $54,000-$56,000
- Bearish: Buy $46,000-$48,000 + $48,000-$50,000
- Neutral: Buy $50,000-$52,000

## Example Trade

**Market**: "BTC Price in 30 Days"
**Your Prediction**: BTC will be between $52,000-$54,000

**Action**: Buy 10 shares of [$52,000-$54,000) range
**Cost**: ~2.5 SUSD (price depends on current market probability)
**Potential Payout**: 10 SUSD if BTC settles between $52,000-$54,000
**Profit**: 7.5 SUSD if correct
