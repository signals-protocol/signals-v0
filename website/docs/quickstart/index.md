## How Range Trading Works

### Understanding Range Securities

Instead of betting "yes" or "no", you buy **ranges**:

**Example: ETH Price Market**

- Current price: $3,100
- Available ranges: $2,800-$3,000, $3,000-$3,200, $3,200-$3,400, etc.
- Each range pays **1 USDC** if ETH settles in that range

### Price = Probability

If a range costs 0.25 USDC, the market thinks there's a 25% chance of that outcome.

### Multiple Ranges

You can buy multiple ranges to express complex predictions:

- Bullish: Buy $3,200-$3,400 + $3,400-$3,600
- Bearish: Buy $2,600-$2,800 + $2,800-$3,000
- Neutral: Buy $3,000-$3,200

## Example Trade

**Market**: "ETH Price in 30 Days"
**Your Prediction**: ETH will be between $3,200-$3,400

**Action**: Buy 10 shares of [$3,200-$3,400) range
**Cost**: ~2.5 USDC (price depends on current market probability)
**Potential Payout**: 10 USDC if ETH settles between $3,200-$3,400
**Profit**: 7.5 USDC if correct
