# Events Reference Guide

The Signals protocol emits comprehensive events that enable tracking of market activity, position changes, and system operations. These events provide essential data for building user interfaces, conducting analysis, and monitoring protocol health.

## Market Lifecycle Events

Market creation generates events that capture initial parameters and configuration. The MarketCreated event includes the market identifier, tick range boundaries, liquidity parameter alpha, start and end times, and other configuration values. This information establishes the foundation for tracking all subsequent market activity.

Settlement events mark the transition from active trading to final outcome determination. MarketSettled events include the settlement value, calculated settlement tick, and timestamp. These events trigger the transition to the claiming phase and provide authoritative outcome data for all positions within the market.

## Position Management Events

Position opening generates PositionOpened events that record the creation of new range securities holdings. These events capture the position token identifier, market reference, tick range boundaries, share quantity, and cost paid. The events provide complete information needed to track position origins and initial conditions.

Position modifications through increase and decrease operations generate corresponding PositionIncreased and PositionDecreased events. These events record the change in share quantity and associated costs or proceeds. Together with opening events, they provide a complete transaction history for each position.

Position closure generates PositionClosed events when holdings are eliminated entirely through selling all shares back to the market. These events mark the end of position lifecycle before settlement and record final proceeds received.

## Settlement and Claiming Events

Claiming operations generate PositionClaimed events that record successful payout retrieval by position holders. These events include the position identifier, claimed amount, and timestamp. They provide definitive records of which positions have been successfully claimed and when payouts were distributed.

Batch settlement processing generates events that efficiently record outcomes for multiple positions simultaneously. These events reduce gas costs while maintaining complete auditability of settlement results across all positions within a market.

## Tree Operations and Technical Events

Range factor application generates RangeFactorApplied events that record the mathematical operations underlying position changes. These events capture the tick range affected, multiplication factor applied, and context of the operation. While primarily technical, they provide detailed audit trails of all mathematical operations.

Tree flushing operations generate events when pending factors are propagated down the segment tree structure. These events help monitor the internal state management of the protocol and can be useful for debugging or optimization analysis.

## Event Data Structure Patterns

Position-related events consistently include market identifiers to enable filtering and aggregation by market. Token identifiers provide unique position tracking across the entire protocol. Tick ranges use consistent lower-bound inclusive, upper-bound exclusive conventions.

Monetary amounts in events follow the protocol's precision conventions with internal 18-decimal calculations and external 6-decimal representations. Cost and proceeds values reflect the user-facing amounts after precision conversion and rounding application.

Timestamp fields use block timestamps for consistency with blockchain state. These values provide ordering and timing information while acknowledging the inherent limitations of blockchain time accuracy.

## Monitoring and Analysis Applications

Volume analysis can be conducted by aggregating PositionOpened and PositionIncreased events to track market participation over time. Price impact analysis requires correlating position events with RangeFactorApplied events to understand how trading activity affects market pricing.

Settlement accuracy assessment involves comparing market-estimated probabilities derived from trading activity against actual outcomes recorded in settlement events. This analysis helps evaluate the information aggregation effectiveness of the prediction markets.

Liquidity analysis can examine the relationship between position size and price impact by correlating position events with factor application events. This information helps assess market efficiency and capital adequacy for different trading scenarios.

User behavior analysis involves tracking sequences of position events to understand trading patterns, holding periods, and strategic approaches. Privacy considerations should be balanced against analytical value when conducting such research.

## Integration Best Practices

Event monitoring systems should implement appropriate filtering to focus on relevant events while avoiding unnecessary data processing. Market-specific filters help isolate activity for particular prediction markets without processing unrelated events.

Error handling should account for potential blockchain reorganizations that might temporarily affect event ordering or availability. Robust systems implement retry logic and state reconciliation to handle these edge cases gracefully.

Rate limiting considerations apply when accessing events through external providers or blockchain nodes. High-frequency analysis applications should implement appropriate caching and batching to avoid overwhelming underlying infrastructure.

Data validation ensures that event data meets expected formats and constraints before integration into analytical systems. This validation helps identify potential issues early and maintains data quality for downstream analysis.
